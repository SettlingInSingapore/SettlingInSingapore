# Project Idea: Settling In Singapore

##Aim: 
Familiarise both tourists and locals with aspects of Singapore they might not know about. 

##Features: 
The app is about Singaporean culture. We have subdivided the content encompassed within Singaporean culture into several categories, like Singlish (our slang), our food (e.g. Nasi Lemak) and Singaporean history. Within each category, users will see either a dictionary overview of all the individual items or switch to full screen mode and see each item and its description on the screen. At the bottom of this list in each category, there is a quiz that users can play to test their knowledge of that category. Also in each category, there is a ‘Guess the Word’ game where users can put their phone on their heads and have their friends act out the word for themselves to guess, in the style of charades.

##Target Audience:
###**Target user**  	>Type of information they need & Value
**Tourists** Insider Tips for getting around Singapore

**New immigrants**	Familiarisation with Singaporean culture & Singlish (slang)

**New immigrants**	Important Resources to get settled in

**Locals**	Pastime; Spend time knowing more about the less-known parts of Singaporean culture

**Casual Gamers**	Quizzes on local culture & playing a game with a group of friends

##Monetisation: 
The app will be free and revenue is garnered through in-game advertisements, and micropayments if we manage to code it.

##Team: 
Our team consists of several coders and a graphic designer. The group will brainstorm upon the look and feel of the app, and the graphic designer will be in-charge of turning this style into reality. The coders will implement the app with the graphic designer’s guidelines as well as write the code powering the app. Some of us are multi-talented with business and management acumen and we will be charting the path of the app development systematically while not stifling creativity as well as planning and implementing the business strategies of the app.

##App Activity Flowchart
- Button on HomeScreen leads to Settings
- ImageButtons are displayed on the HomeScreen; they open the respective category’s activity.
- In each category, user sees the ListView of vocabulary. User can opt to change to fullscreen mode to view each word/phrase in clearer & larger text, with illustration.
- User can also press on each word/phrase that brings them to a new Activity that shows the word/phrase in clearer & larger text, with illustration.
- On the category activity, below the ListView, the user can choose to start a quiz or a game, which then brings them to that activity.
- After the quiz or game, they are taken to a score screen. The score screen will be the same for all quizzes and games, but changes depending on no. of qns answered and category etc.
